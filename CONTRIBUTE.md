## Commit Convention

We are following [this](https://devbrotherhood.github.io/cmc/) convention for commits and everyone must follow it within the project.

## Linter and Code formatter

The linter used in the project is [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), while the code formatter is [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Make sure you have the proper extensions installed in your editor.
